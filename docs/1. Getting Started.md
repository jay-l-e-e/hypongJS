## Before We Start

#### 1. Create the root html file in your own directory and then write some strings in html like below.

`/project/index.html`
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <!-- ...something in head -->
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- ...something in body -->
  </body>
</html>
```

#### 2. Load the hypongJS and then add a `div` tag with `id="stage"` into body.

`/project/index.html`
```html
  <body>
    <div id="stage"></div>
  </body>
```

#### 3. Add some `script` to next of the `stage div` to launch the game.

`/project/index.html`
```html
    <div id="stage"></div>
    <script type="text/javascript">
      /* hypongJS select an element by id */
      const stage = hypong('stage');
      stage.run();
    </script>
```

## That's it!
