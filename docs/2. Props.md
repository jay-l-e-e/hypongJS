## Immutable Props
#### You cannot set these props.
|Name|Describe|Type|Default|
|------|------|:----:|-------:|
|`homeX`|The home's racket x axis point. You can get this props if you want. but cannot set. If you want to change this value, see the `racketMargin` in above table.|Int|45|
|`awayX`|The away's racket x axis point. You can get this props if you want. but cannot set. If you want to change this value, see the `racketMargin` in above table.|Int|405|
|`ballVector{x,y}`|The ball's vector object. You can get this props if you want. but cannot set.|Object|{`x`,`y`}|

## Examples
#### Now you can change the props completely freely.
```js
  const stage = hypong('#stage'); // Now 'stage' is an instance of hypong
  stage.width = 100;
  stage.height += 50;
  stage.speed -= 10;
  stage.run();
```
#### Alternatively, you can do this through initialization.
```js
  const stage = hypong('#stage', {
    width: 100,
    height: 300,
    speed: 40,
  });
  stage.run();
```

## Setters Ripple Effect
#### Some props affect the layout or state when changed.
```js
  ['width', setterWithRender],
  ['height', setterWithRender],
  ['ballSize', setterWithRender],
  ['racketWidth', setterWithRender],
  ['racketHeight', setterWithRender],
  ['racketMargin', setterWithRender],
  ['homeY', setterWithHomeRacketDraw],
  ['awayY', setterWithAwayRacketDraw],
  ['background', setterWithDrawStage],
  ['racketColor', setterWithSpawnRacket],
  ['ballColor', setterWithSpawnBall],
  ['fps', setterWithRestart],
  ['onStart', setterWithRestart],
  ['onStop', setterWithRestart],
  ['onCollision', setterWithRestart],
  ['onFrameStart', setterWithRestart],
  ['onFrameEnd', setterWithRestart]
```
`setterWithRender`: when this props change, all the game displays are re-rendered.

`setterWithHomeRacketDraw`: when this props change, home's racket is re-rendered.

`setterWithAwayRacketDraw`: when this props change, away's racket is re-rendered.

`setterWithDrawStage`: when this props change, the game stage is re-rendered.

`setterWithSpawnRacket`: when this props change, the rackets are spawned.

`setterWithSpawnBall`: when this props change, the ball is spawned.

`setterWithRestart`: when this props change, the game is restarted.

### Some Tricks
#### To find out how to avoid the ripple effect:
```js
  instance._width = value,
  instance._height = value,
  instance._ballSize = value,
  /* ... */
  
  /* or */
  
  this._width = value,
  this._height = value,
  this._ballSize = value,
  /* ... */
  `just add a hyphen to prefix.`
```

## Hooks
#### hypongJS provides some hooks for handling the game instance.
```js
  ['onStart'],
  ['onStop'],
  ['onCollision'],
  ['onFrameStart'],
  ['onFrameEnd']
```
#### `onStart`
`onStart` is occurs when the game start.
```js
  const startGameHandler = (currentState) => {
    console.log('Current State: ' + JSON.stringify(currentState, null, 2));
    /*
      Current State: {
        "ballX": 225,
        "ballY": 125,
        "homeX": 45,
        "homeY": 125,
        "awayX": 405,
        "awayY": 125,
        "frames": 86,
        "homeScore": 0,
        "awayScore": 0,
        "ballVector": {
          "x": -5,
          "y": -0.25
        }
      }
    */
  };
  const stage = hypong('stage');
  stage.onStart = startGameHandler;
```
#### `onStop`
`onStop` is occurs when the game stop.
```js
  const stopGameHandler = (isTemporary, currentState) => {
    if (isTemporary) {
      console.log('Game stopped but still free to move the rackets.');
    } else {
      console.log('Game stopped with freeze the rackets.');
    }
    console.log('Current State: ' + JSON.stringify(currentState, null, 2));
    /*
      Current State: { ... }
    */
  };
  const stage = hypong('stage');
  stage.onStop = stopGameHandler;
```
#### `onCollision`
`onCollision` is occurs when the ball touches another objects.
```js
  const collisionHandler = (currentState, collisionInfo) => {
    console.log('Collision Info: ' + JSON.stringify(collisionInfo, null, 2));
    /*
      Collision Info: {
        "LRDirection": null, // String('L' or 'R') or null. The direction in which the ball hit the left or right of the target
        "TBScore": 1 // Float. The score in which the ball hit the top or bottom of the target
      }
    */
    console.log('Current State: ' + JSON.stringify(currentState, null, 2));
    /*
      Current State: { ... }
    */
  };
  const stage = hypong('stage');
  stage.onCollision = collisionHandler;
```
#### `onFrameStart`
`onFrameStart` is occurs when a frame start.
```js
  const frameStartHandler = (currentState) => {
    console.log('Current State: ' + JSON.stringify(currentState, null, 2));
    /*
      Current State: { ... }
    */
  };
  const stage = hypong('stage');
  stage.onFrameStart = frameStartHandler;
```
#### `onFrameEnd`
`onFrameEnd` is occurs when a frame end.
```js
  const frameEndHandler = (currentState) => {
    console.log('Current State: ' + JSON.stringify(currentState, null, 2));
    /*
      Current State: { ... }
    */
  };
  const stage = hypong('stage');
  stage.onFrameEnd = frameEndHandler;
```
