|`onStop`|The event occurs when the game stop. You can get or set this prop if you want.|Function|null|
|`onFrameStart`|The event occurs when a frame start. You can get or set this prop if you want.|Function|null|
|`onFrameEnd`|The event occurs when a frame end. You can get or set this prop if you want.|Function|null|
|`onCollision`|The event occurs when ball touches another objects. You can get or set this prop if you want.|Function|null|
|`ballX`|The ball x axis point. You can get or set this prop if you want. (this prop can only be set during runtime.)|Int|225|
|`ballY`|The ball y axis point. You can get or set this prop if you want. (this prop can only be set during runtime.)|Int|125|
|`ballVector.x`|The force amount that affects the x axis. You can get or set this prop if you want. (this prop can only be set during runtime.)|Float|5 or -5|
|`ballVector.y`|The force amount that affects the y axis. You can get or set this prop if you want. (this prop can only be set during runtime.)|Float|0.25 or -0.25|

## Immutable Props
#### You cannot set these props.
|Name|Describe|Type|Default|
|------|------|:----:|-------:|
|`homeX`|The home's racket x axis point. You can get this props if you want. but cannot set. If you want to change this value, see the `racketMargin` in above table.|Int|45|
|`awayX`|The away's racket x axis point. You can get this props if you want. but cannot set. If you want to change this value, see the `racketMargin` in above table.|Int|405|
|`ballVector{x,y}`|The ball's vector object. You can get this props if you want. but cannot set.|Object|{`x`,`y`}|

## Setters Ripple Effect
#### Some props affect the layout or state when changed.
```js
  ['width', setterWithRender],
  ['height', setterWithRender],
  ['ballSize', setterWithRender],
  ['racketWidth', setterWithRender],
  ['racketHeight', setterWithRender],
  ['racketMargin', setterWithRender],
  ['homeY', setterWithHomeRacketDraw],
  ['awayY', setterWithAwayRacketDraw],
  ['background', setterWithDrawStage],
  ['racketColor', setterWithSpawnRacket],
  ['ballColor', setterWithSpawnBall],
  ['fps', setterWithRestart],
  ['onStart', setterWithRestart],
  ['onStop', setterWithRestart],
  ['onCollision', setterWithRestart],
  ['onFrameStart', setterWithRestart],
  ['onFrameEnd', setterWithRestart]
```
`setterWithRender`: when this props change, all the game displays are re-rendered.

`setterWithHomeRacketDraw`: when this props change, home's racket is re-rendered.

`setterWithAwayRacketDraw`: when this props change, away's racket is re-rendered.

`setterWithDrawStage`: when this props change, the game stage is re-rendered.

`setterWithSpawnRacket`: when this props change, the rackets are spawned.

`setterWithSpawnBall`: when this props change, the ball is spawned.

`setterWithRestart`: when this props change, the game is restarted.

## Some Tricks
#### To find out how to avoid the ripple effect:
```js
  instance._width = value,
  instance._height = value,
  instance._ballSize = value,
  /* ... */
  
  /* or */
  
  this._width = value,
  this._height = value,
  this._ballSize = value,
  /* ... */
  `just add a hyphen to prefix.`
```

## Examples
#### Now you can change the props completely freely.
```js
  const stage = hypong('#stage');
  stage.width = 100;
  stage.height += 50;
  stage.speed -= 10;
  stage.run();
```
